Pulse
Overview
In the last couple of decades, biomedical and smart healthcare research has witnessed rapid growth, resulting in a significant increase in experimental data (i.e., Big Data).The sheer volume of data makes it impossible for a human to analyze and read all related articles, complicating even the extraction of field-specific publications.The diversification and explosive growth in healthcare literature and the pharmaceutical industry highlight the need for automation tools for knowledge-based discovery.

Pulse is designed to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive solution for pill schedule management, doctor appointments, and diet management reminders. It includes a mobile application with notifications and a physical box to assist patients with conditions such as Dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s in remembering their medication at the right time and in the correct order.

Problem Definition
Managing medications is challenging for patients due to the need to remember schedules and understand interactions between different drugs. This complexity increases when multiple drugs are involved.

Project Objectives
- Storing and Managing Patient Drugs: Especially for the elderly and those who have a strict medication regimen.
- Supervision: Allow the person responsible for the patient to supervise the patient's healthcare.
- Avoid Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI): Help the patient avoid any harmful interactions between different medications.
- Drug Alternatives: Help the patient know about other drug alternatives.

Features
- Pill Schedule Management: Set up and manage your pill schedule with reminders to ensure timely medication.
- Doctor Appointment Reminders: Keep track of and receive reminders for doctor appointments.
- Diet Management: Plan and get reminders for diet and nutrition.
- User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive interface designed for easy navigation.
- Physical Reminder Box: A dedicated physical box that helps patients remember their medication schedule.

Usage
- Adding Pills: Navigate to the "Add Pill" section to input your medication details.
- Setting Reminders: Set up reminders for medication, doctor appointments, and diet plans.
- Viewing Schedules: Access and manage your pill schedule, appointments, and diet plans.
- Using the Physical Box: Set up and use the physical box to assist with medication reminders.
